This tutorial takes a practical and coding-focused approach. We'll learn how to use decision trees and random forests to solve a real-world problem from Kaggle:

QUESTION: The Rain in Australia dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. Here's a small sample from the dataset:



As a data scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, you are tasked with creating a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow.



Let's install and import some required libraries before we begin.
